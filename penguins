-- Extra Practice. Create a table with at least 4 columns, 2 constraints, 3 rows about anything I want.


-- First I create my table

CREATE TABLE penguins (
    penguin_type text,
    location text,
    life_span_max INTEGER CHECK(life_span_max >= 1),
    height_max REAL CHECK(height_max BETWEEN 1 AND 7),
    speed_mph REAL NOT NULL
);


--Then I select everything to ensure I've created it properly
SELECT *
FROM penguins;



--I then insert the values that I want

INSERT INTO penguins (penguin_type, location, life_span_max, height_max, speed_mph)
    VALUES ('Emperor', 'Antarctica', 20, 4.3, 5.6),
            ('Adelie', 'Antarctic Coast', 30, 2.5, 5.6),
            ('African', 'African Coast', 15, 2.25, 4.4),
            ('Macaroni', 'Antarctic Peninsula', 15, 2.3, 9.3),
            ('Little', 'New Zealand Coast', 6, 1.1, 3.9),
            ('King', 'Antarctica', 26, 3.25, 6),
            ('Royal', 'Australia', 20, 2.3, 20),
            ('Galapagos', 'Galapagos Islands', 20, 1.75, 21.7),
            ('Chinstrap', 'Antarctic Peninsula', 20, 2, 18);
            

--I then run it again to ensure that I've added the data correctly
SELECT *
FROM penguins;




--Time to analyze data!


--Q1. Rename columns to be easier to understand

SELECT penguin_type AS 'Penguin Type', location AS 'Location', life_span_max AS 'Max Life Span (years)', height_max AS 'Max Height (ft)', speed_mph AS 'Max Speed (mph'
FROM penguins;

--Q2. What is the average life span of all penguins in the table?
SELECT AVG(life_span_max) AS 'AVG Life Span'
FROM penguins;

--Q3. Round that to two decimal points
SELECT ROUND (AVG(life_span_max), 2) AS 'Average Life Span'
FROM penguins;

--Q4. Which is the fastest penguin?
SELECT penguin_type, MAX(speed_mph)
FROM penguins;

--Q5. How many distinct locations are there in our table?
SELECT DISTINCT location
FROM penguins;

--Q6. Which location is the shortest penguin from?
SELECT location AS 'Location', MIN(height_max) AS 'Minimum Height'
FROM penguins;
